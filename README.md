Repository for Video Game Programming related code
In this repo is the GameF22, imageLoader, GameBase, Camera, Rect, Soldier, BadSoldier, Animation and Platform. 
And a couple of in-game Assets like pictures for the background and stuff. Also, the class soldier and Badsoldier should
definately be renamed to MainCharactor and Zombies, i forgot to do that. You may not need all files,
especially the Soldier and BadSoldier images, those can be replaced with the main Charactor and Zombies sprites. 
Feel free to add your section of the project to these files. Just pull or download a zip of this repo and add your
assigned sections. fell free to ask questions about portions that you don't understand.
