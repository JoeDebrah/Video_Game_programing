First clone, pull or download the "Test" folder into whatever location you like.
Second, go into eclipse, create a new project. Don't name the repo with a name that already exists in your eclipse workspace.
Next, in that newly created project folder, right-clikc it and click "import". It will take you to a page, unger "General" choose 
"File System". Next you'll choose the directory you saved the github repo you cloned, pulled or downloaded and click add that folder.
After choosing it, before you click finish, where it says "Into folder" make sure it is the new project you created.
Next click finish. It will load it up, it may or may not ask you to override some stuff but if it doesnt dont worry at all.
When its done loading, go to the project you created and it should be there, go to src, com.main, and GameF22. Now try to run it
and hopefully it should work. Questions!!!?
